    "\n",
    "In the wake of World War II, people in the United States suddenly had an abundance of employment opportunities. With men joining the military to fight overseas and the creation of many new industrial jobs to support the war effort, the United States workforce was facing an unusual problem of not having enough workers, particularly in agriculture. The United States government found a willing partner to address this problem in the Mexican government, which was eager to boost its economy by providing work for its unemployed citizens. These simultaneous desires led to an agreement between the two nations that would become known as the Bracero Program, lasting from 1942 until its termination long after the end of World War II in 1964.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bracero Program - a term that comes from the Spanish word \"brazo\" meaning \"arm\" in reference to manual labor - was a temporary work program that would bring Mexican men to the United States under work contracts for periods between six weeks and six months before returning back to Mexico. After going through a screening and documentation process with the Mexican government, the United States would provide transportation, temporary housing, and food for the Bracero workers in addition to their temporary jobs. By 1964, the United States government ended the Bracero Program, partly because people in the United States worried about the impact of Braceros on domestic labor. Throughout the program, there were also concerns about increased unauthorized immigration from Mexico because it was often easier for both the Mexican workers and farm owners, as Mexican workers did not have to go through the tedious process of screening and documentation (that often required bribes) and farm owners  did not have to provide the required housing, food, and transportation for workers not under Bracero contracts.\n",
